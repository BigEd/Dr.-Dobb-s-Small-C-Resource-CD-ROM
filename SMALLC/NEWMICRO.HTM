<hr>New Micros, Inc. (NMI) produces small, dedicated, board-level computer products. 
Various Single Board Computers (SBCs) are based on a number of different 
microprocessors (CPUs). Added peripherals, from serial ports to servo motor 
controllers, and Analog to Digital Converters (A/D) to Optoisolated Input/Outputs,
expand the SBCs capabilities. The SBCs and peripherals can stack 
together to make compact units, depending on the mechanical format, 
used.<p>

Our packaged development systems include a computer and programming languages.  
NMI provides software for program development, and embedded applications.  
Small C compilers,  Max-FORTH, and BASIC are examples of development languages. 
A new real-time programming language, ISO-MAX, provides Iso-structure (mulittasking without a multitasker!) and a graphical programming interface (GUI). 
User manuals, some assemblers and utilities, and other software,
are also available.When a multiboard solution won't do, or additional features are desired 
on an existing product, we make custom circuit boards to your specification.  <p>

Our real-time programming system, IsoMAX, promises to revolutionize the way 
real-time programming applications are done, using an Iso-structure layer
to implement multitasking without a multitasker. Combining hardened, 
optoisolated, inputs and outputs with a motherboard, the
NMIO, series boards are larger, more "industrially" oriented than 
previouslly offered by NMI. Available in 16 or 32 Inputs/Outputs combinations.
Visit the News Page at our web site at <a href="http://newmicros.com">
http://www.newmicros.com </a> for details on
IsoMAX and NMIO, plus Easy-A MultiDrop Communications Protocol,
and MAXDDE and other items of interest. <p>

For 15 years we've been making circuit boards of our own design, 
and designing them for others. NMI is the parent company of 
Cibi-Ardy, International, a company which provides circuit board design 
services. Cibi-Ardy is also the world's leader in quality, 
electronic, CAD parts libraries. You may want to contact us, or read about our 
history, or hear our Bonnie and Clyde story--all at <a href="http://newmicros.com">
