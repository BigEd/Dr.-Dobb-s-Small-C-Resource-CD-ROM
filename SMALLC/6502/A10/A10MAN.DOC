           The Newcastle Handirom - an aid for the handicapped
 
 
 
 
Introduction:
 
 The Handirom was developed to enable a person with limited motor control
to operate a microcomputer.  The  control  over  the  computer,  although
limited,  will  present  the  user  with full control over wordprocessing
utilities such as View 3.0 and  Wordwise  Plus,  various spreadsheets and
databases  or  even to write and run their own  programs  in  a  language
environment such as Basic, Comal, Pascal or Lisp etc.
 
 In operation, the system claims the lower part of the screen on which it
draws up a grid representing  the  keys  on  the computer keyboard (in an
optimised  order).  The  grid  is scanned vertically whenever the program
requires keyboard input. Operation of  a  button  connected to the "fire"
button inputs on the Analogue socket at the  rear  of  the  computer will
cause  the  grid  to  be scanned horizontally until either the button has
been pressed again to select  a  letter  or command, or the grid has been
scanned horizontally twice. In this case the line is assumed to have been
wrongly selected and the vertical scan resumes.
 
 A useful feature of the  Handirom  is  that  the  keyboard  operation is
mostly unaffected and the two input devices may be used together.
 
 Five grid layouts are available; lower case, upper case, common words, a
control screen with function key  emulator and a "*" command screen. Each
of the grids also contains a  number  of commands which will be described
later.
 
 The microcomputer system must be  fitted  with a bank of sideways ram in
order for the Handirom to work. In this way, the whole of the user memory
is available for documents or programs.
 
 In  addition to the grids  mentioned  above,  custom  wordlists  may  be
created as  described  under  the section "Editing wordlists" on page 9.
These wordlists (of which three are supplied on the disc) are loaded into
sideways ram also, again maximising the amount of user ram.
 
Note:
 As a number of sideways  ram  modules  are commercially available, it is
unlikely that the Handirom has been tested with all of them. In the event
of the Handirom not working please write to  the address given at the end
of this guide giving full system details and the  type  of  sideways  ram
fitted.

Handirom initialisation:
 
Having verified that sideways ram  is  available  and  with  some form of
switch  connected  to  the  analogue  port,  you  are ready to  load  the
Handirom.
 
 Insert the disc into the  default disc drive and, while holding down the
SHIFT key, depress the BREAK key momentarily. If all is well, you will be
greeted  by  the  Handirom  welcome  screen.  Operating   the  switch  or
depressing any key (with the exception of the escape and break keys) will
prompt you for the sideways ram bank  that  you  wish  to  use  (refer to
manufacturers data).
 
 If you do not wish to use socket 7 (Master) or socket 15 (BBC) (assuming
that they are available) then  selecting  the  NO  option  will  list the
sideways  firmware  installed  and  prompt  for bank 4-7 (Master) or 8-15
(BBC).
 
 Upon selection of a suitable  socket,  the  Handirom  is loaded from the
disc and the user is asked to select the  speed  of the scan. Don't worry
if the speed is not quite right, as it can be adjusted later.
 
 The sound on/off option is  next.  This just "blips" on each step of the
horizontal or vertical scan. Again, this option can be adjusted later.
 
 Now select the wordprocessor option.  This  simply means that the system
will automatically insert spaces after a word  has been selected from the
wordlist or common words grid or even after  a  full  stop  (useful  when
writing  a  letter).  In  addition,  the full stop will cause the capital
letters screen to be selected for  one  character  only, after which, the
lower case screen will be selected.
 
 The wordlist required may now  be  loaded.  Three  examples:  W.STDWORD,
W.TEST  and W.NEWWORD are supplied on the disc. The program "EDIT",  also
on the  disc  will allow the editing or creation of custom wordlists with
the Handirom active.  About 9K of a 16K bank of sideways ram is available
for the wordlist selected.

Saving the configuration:
 
  If you are unfamiliar with  the  Handirom  please  answer  no  to  this
option.
 
  A  yes  answer to save  the  configuration  will  prompt  for  a  blank
formatted disc to  be  placed  into the current drive.  Pressing a key or
the  switch  will  save the whole  of  the  sideways  ram  (Handirom  and
wordlist) together with details of  socket number and options selected to
the disc.  By copying the program  "SRLOAD"  onto  the disc (BBC B only),
the system may be loaded in with just SHIFT-BREAK,   without  the need to
step through the welcome and option screens again.
 
  This method has the added advantage that it allows easy distribution of
the program throughout a class,   enabling each pupil to have his/her own
copy without the expense of multiple master copies (no,  we don't mind!).
 
  The command below will work with most disc filing systems:
 
          *COPY <source> <destination> <filename>
 
  e.g. Assuming a single disc drive as drive number 0,  type:
 
          *COPY 0 0 SRLOAD
 
  followed by return.

Using the Handirom:
 
  By now you should be  aware  of  a  scanning  grid at the bottom of the
screen and have probably tried pressing the button.  The grid  looks like
this:
 
              >> :SCRN :WL :SPC :RET :DEL :CAP :ESC
                i  t  r  o  l  p  .  ,  {  }  :REPEAT
                e  a  c  m  x  v  :  ;  (  )  :CTRL
                n  s  h  y  k  z  !  ?  <  >  :WWESC
                d  f  g  q  +  -  *  /  =  &  \  ~
                u  b  w  j  "  '  @  `  $  #  ^  |
                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  [  ]
                      Speed 8  Word-processor
 
    Try selecting :SPC from the grid.  To do this,  wait until the cursor
is  on  the  top line  and  press  the  button.   The  cursor  now  scans
horizontally.  Press your button once when :SPC is pointed to and a space
will be printed on the upper screen.
 
Other ":" directives:
 
  :RET      this is identical to pressing the RETURN key on the keyboard.
  :DEL      DELETEs the previous character.
  :CAP      selects the capital letters screen.
  :ESC      emulates the ESCAPE key.
  :REPEAT   repeats the last letter typed until the button is pressed.
  :CTRL     followed by a  letter  allows  control  keys to be emulated.
            This is most useful for wordprocessor operation.
  :WWESC    generates  an ESCAPE event and turns off  the  Handirom  grid
            until the  button  is  pressed.   Useful for returning to the
            Handirom  after  reading  a  screen that  would  normally  be
            corrupted.
  :WL       after selecting the initial letter  of  a word,  this command
            will bring up a screen consisting of words beginning with the
            same letter unless no wordlist has been loaded.
            e.g. after selecting "a" and ":WL";
 
             >> :NL  :QL
                after       another       august
                afternoon   anyone        away
                again       anything      awry
                almost      anywhere
                always      apple
                angry       april
                      Speed 8  Word-processor

           The Newcastle Handirom - an aid for the handicapped
 
 
 
 
  :NL       on  this screen will bring up the next list if there are more
            words beginning with the letter selected.
  :QL       quits the wordlist screen.
  :SCRN     will  allow  you  select any of the grids below (grid 0 being
            the lower case screen).
 
  SCREEN 1 - Upper case screen
 
             >> :SCRN :WL :SPC :RET :DEL :CAP :ESC
                I  T  R  O  L  P  .  ,  {  }  :REPEAT
                E  A  C  M  X  V  :  ;  (  )  :CTRL
                N  S  H  Y  K  Z  !  ?  <  >  :KEY
                D  F  G  Q  +  -  *  /  =  &  \  %
                U  B  W  J  "  '  @  `  $  #  ^  |
                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  [  ]
                      Speed 8  Word-processor
 
            You may have noticed the :KEY command that has crept in here.
            This turns off the  grid,   clears the screen and then does a
            RETURN.   Useful  when the whole screen  is  preferable  e.g.
            LISTing a basic program  or  *TYPEing  text  from disc.  If a
            CTRL-N (list in paged mode),  the button  acts like the SHIFT
            key until the listing is finished.
            A further press of the button will bring the grid back again.
 
  SCREEN 2 - Commonly used words
 
             >> :SCRN :WL :SPC :RET :DEL :CAP :ESC

                :CU     :CD     :CL     :CR   :REPEAT
                :SCU    :SCD    :SCL    :SCR  :CTRL
                :CCU    :CCD    :CCL    :CCR  :WWESC
                :FK     :SFK    :CFK    :SCFK :KEY

                      Speed 8  Word-processor
 
  This  may look a little daunting but is really very simple.  When using
a wordprocessor  such  a  View  3.0,   the function keys are used for all
manner of things which is exactly what screen three allows you to do.

Editing Wordlists:
 
  The wordlists may be edited,  or new ones created,  with or without the
Handirom active.
 
  To do this,  type CHAIN"EDIT" or CH."EDIT" followed by RETURN (you must
be in BASIC to do this).
 
  The editor is easy to use and prompts the user firstly for the filename
of  the wordlist to edit or RETURN for a new wordlist.  The wordlists are
all kept  in  directory  W but there is no need to specify this directory
with.
 
  Try loading STDWORD then add  and  delete words to familiarise yourself
with the editor.  Using the F)inish option will prompt for a filename.
 
  Do not use the original filename or you run the risk of corrupting your
data (assuming that the file is not locked).
 
Limitations:
 
  Handirom  will NOT work with the Inter Word wordprocessor,  Acornsoft's
Basic Editor or any basic program using INKEY(n).  It is also unlikely to
work with programs or roms which use text or graphics windows.
 
  A further  limitation  is  that  the  cursor  editing  and copying keys
produce   unpredictable  results  in  the  command  type  of  environment
i.e.  where  a  "*"  command  may  be  issued.  The best way to return to
normal  operation  after an anomaly has occurred is to  press  escape  or
return from the keyboard.
 
  When using a  wordprocessor  such  as  View  3.0,   which  obeys window
definitions  on  startup,   it  is  necessary to have the Handirom active
before entering the command *WORD and  to  issue  the *WORD command after
each change of screen mode (within View,  of course).
 
  Although  the  Handirom  is compatible with the BBC micro or the Master
with or without the  6502  Tube,   the  Tube  itself must be switched off
before attempting to load into sideways ram.  Once loaded,   the Tube may
be switched on and a CTRL-BREAK issued to initialise it.
