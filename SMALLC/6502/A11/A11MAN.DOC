                         KEYLOCK TOOLKIT - MANUAL

Key  lock  has  been designed to allow entry of key combinations such as
SHIFT-ed  letters  and  CTRL-SHIFT-ed  function  keys  using  single  key
sequences on the BBC and MASTER range of microcomputers.
 
Installation.
 
  Two versions of Key lock are supplied. RAMKEY is the low ram version
intended as a  demonstration  version  because  the area of memory used
(page  &9  to  page  &C)  may be  overwritten  by  a  user  program,
re-installation mey be required.

To install RAMKEY, type:
 
                   */RAMKEY followed by RETURN.
 
  The second version is called ROMKEY. This  is a true ROM image which may
be either blown into EPROM and permanently installed  inside  the machine,
or may be loaded into sideways ram if this is  available  (in  which case,
follow  the  instructions  of the ram board manufacturer to load ROMKEY or
use the loader file  "Srload"  supplied.  This  has the same syntax as the
SRLOAD on the Master series).

  The  Acorn  Master  series  of computers have four banks of sideways ram
(slots 4 to 7) built  in,  therefore,  to  install ROMKEY into say bank 7,
type:
 
              *SRLOAD ROMKEY 8000 7 followed by RETURN.
                    (CTRL-BREAK to initialise)
 
                    *TYPE T.MANUAL for instructions.
 
Operation.
 
  Operation  is  very simple, pressing the SHIFT key once  followed  by  a
letter or number  key  gives  the  same  result as depressing the two keys
simultaneously in normal operation.  The CTRL key operates  in exactly the
same way (CTRL G - beep, CTRL L - clear screen etc),  but perhaps the most
useful application is the operation of CTRL, SHIFT or  CTRL-SHIFT function
key combinations in a wordprocessor such as View 3.0, these being a little
awkward for anyone.

 This uses the following abbreviations:
fsp   : file specification or filename
drv   : disc drive number
rom   : sideways rom number in decimal or hex
T     : select tube
addr  : hexadecimal start address
+len  : "+" followed by length in hex
end   : last address in hex
<xxxx>   - must be specified
(<xxxx>) - optional
 
 
Command: *ASC <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
Description: Memory dump in ascii format.
 
Command: *BOOT (<drv>)
Description:Execute !BOOT file on disc. Useful for some physically
handicapped persons.
 
Command: *CATALL
Description: Catalogue all files on ADFS disc.
 
Command: *CLOSE
Description: Close any open files. Equivalent to CLOSE#0 in BASIC.
 
Command: *CHKSUM <rom>
Description: Generate a checksum for any sideways rom image in a format
widely used by commercial eprom programmers.
 
Command: *DIS <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
Description: Disassembly of memory contents in 65C02 mnemonics.
 
Command: *FILESYS
 
 
Description: Returns currently selected filing system.
 
Command: *EXPLAIN
Description: Catalogues disc and if any BASIC programs are found that
have a REM statement in the first line, EXPLAIN will echo the associated
text to the screen. Very useful for finding programs, latest versions etc.
 
Command: *EXPALL
Description: Performs the EXPLAIN command in all directories from the
currently selected one on an ADFS disc.
 
Command: *KILL (<rom>)
Description:  Kills off sideways rom images without having to physically
unplug them. If no rom is specified then you will be prompted for a Y/N
response on each rom. Survives ctrl-break!
 
Command: *INSERT (<rom>)
Description: Opposite to *KILL. If you find that you have killed Keylock
Rom, then corrupting the middle of the stack (&150,&151,&152) followed by
break will restore normality.
 
Command: *KLON
Description: Turns on Keylock facility, thus enabling entry of CTRL and
SHIFTed key combinations with single consecutive key presses. RETURN will
cancel the effect of CTRL or SHIFT if it has been pressed accidentally.
 
Command: *KLOFF
Description: Disables the Keylock facility.
 
Command: *QUIT
Description: Quits current application and enter Keylock Toolkit as a
simple language with a "*" prompt. All input is sent directly to the CLI.
 
Command: *HEX <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
Description: Memory dump in hexadecimal format.
 
Command: *MDUMP <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
Description: Memory dump in hexadecimal and ascii format. Similar in
format to the DFS command *DUMP.
 
Command: *MEDIT <addr> (<rom/T>)
Description: Powerful memory editor/bi-directional disassembler enabling
editing in hex or ascii format. Within the editor, the following keys have
special functions:
 Cursor keys - find your way around the screen with these
 Ctrl-T      - toggle tube/io memory (beeps if no tube present)
 Ctrl-G      - goto address - prompts for four digit hex number
 Ctrl-R      - select sideways rom - prompts for hex number (0-F)
 Ctrl-A      - ascii input as indicated by block cursor
 Ctrl-H      - hexadecimal input - standard cursor
 Ctrl-U      - move address indicated by cursor to top of the screen
 Ctrl-P      - print current screen
 TAB         - changes format of display
Note:
Before entering the editor, a *FX12 1 will make the display scroll faster.
 
Command: *ROMS (<rom>)
Description: Rom lister highlighting the current "active or dead" status
of all roms.
 
Command: *SRLOAD <fsp> <addr> <ramslot>
Description: Loads a rom image into sideways ram. A ctrl-break is often
needed after this.
 
Command: *SRSAVE <fsp> <addr> <+len/end> <rom>
Description: saves the contents of sideways ram or rom socket to a file.
 
Command: *SRWIPE  <ramslot>
Description: erases contents of write-enabled sideways ram.
 
Command: *STAT
Description: produces a dynamic display of the current machine status.
e.g.
 
>*STAT
