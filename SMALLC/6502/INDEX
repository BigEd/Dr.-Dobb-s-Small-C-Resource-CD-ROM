INDEX OF BBC MICRO (6502) SOFTWARE                    Updated 20/08/91 @ 1450

Each item of software on the Archive has been stored in a separate
sub-directory, which is identified by a prefix code.  The list below shows you
the prefixes, and what the package is. 

If you're accessing the files from a terminal, you'll need to change directory
to the sub-directory concerned. For example, if you want the package with
with prefix "a01", you'd do

                 cd micros/bbc/a01

(assuming you're in the top level directory).

Access by FTP is similar: here you always need to give a full pathname for the
files you want, so the files in this directory would be

                 micros/bbc/a01/.....

Within each directory is a file called "00contents" (the first two digits are
zeros), which gives a list of all the other filenames in the directory. Thus,
if you are using FTP, it's best to pull this first to see what's there. So
that, in this example, you'd start by pulling

                 micros/bbc/a01/00contents
