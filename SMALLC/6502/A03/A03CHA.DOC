                             CHAOTIC SET PLOTTING
                             ====================
                                       
                 By Dave Walker, University College, Cardiff.

0. Introduction
===============

Chaotic  sets  are the sets generated by iteration on mathematical formulae of
the non-linear two-dimensional transformations of a plane onto  itself.  These
sets  when plotted can give rise to attractive and interesting pictures. These
are even more interesting when one realizes that the simplest quadratic  forms
give   the  best  results,  containing,  it  is  beleived,  illusive  'strange
attractors', exotic infinity point sets to which the iterates are drawn.

1. History
==========

My interest, and the derivation of this program, come from a lecture  entitled
'Graphic  Potential  Of Recursive Functions' given by Dr Barry Martin of Aston
University at the 20th Anniversary Conference of the British Computer Society.
The subject has been widely studied over the last six years by several  people
including  M.J. Feigenbaum, J. Chandra, H.G. Schuster, P. Fischer & W.P. Smith
while earilier work was carried out by Henon (1976), Metropolis, Stein & Stein
(1973) and Birkoff (1932).

'Chaos' is now emerging in many subjects, examples of which are:

                    Turbulance (fluid flow)
                    Lasers (optics)
                    Josephson junctions (electronics)
                    Stability in particle accelerators (nuclear physics)

2. The Program
==============

2.0 Introduction
----------------

The program is designed as an aid to  examining  these  sets.  It  allows  for
changes  in  expression,  mode and magnification. It can also save and display
pictures and features automatic magnification changes. It is  hoped  that  the
program is compatible with all BBC micros with a DFS and Basic II or higher.

Note:  At  all  levels  a check for data validity is made and the option to go
back and change a value allowed.


2.1 Disk settings
-----------------

The first set of  questions  asked  will  set  up  the  saving  and  reloading
facilities.  Drive  may  be  set to any number 0-3, Directory may be any upper
case character or $. The title must contain at least 1 character and  no  more
than six (the seventh is used to distinguish screens)







                                    PAGE 1

2.2 Mode settings
-----------------

Any  graphics  mode  (0,1,2,4,5)  may  be  used  and  the User Guide should be
consulted about each ones suitability for any graph. Mode 1 gives  a  suitably
high  resolution and a choice of colours. While colour has no direct affect on
the function it changes the asthetic appeal of any given  image  and  if  more
than  one  colour is available in the selected mode then the user is asked how
many they wish to use. These can be set to any given colour by vdu  statements
(see  later). If more than one colour is selected then the user is asked after
how many iterations they wish to change the colour. The option  for  connected
lines is given next. This is implemented only as an aid when experementing (ie
to  find  out  in  which direction a function is going out of bounds) and if a
non-chaotic function such as a sine curve is desired.

2.3 Expression settings
-----------------------

The first questions obtain the expressions for  X1  and  Y1.  These  represent
X(N+1) and Y(N+1) while X and Y are used in these inputs to represent X(N) and
Y(N). N, the number of iterations, and PI may be included as can any BBC Basic
mathematical  expression. The next two questions obtain the initial conditions
for X and Y. These are then checked to be  valid  before  a  magnification  is
asked for. This must be greater than zero and less than the maximum stated. If
the  magnification is less than one then it is condensed before display, if it
is greater than 1 then it is enlarged. If the magnisfication  is  exactly  one
then one pixel equals one unit.

2.4 Commands while generating sets
----------------------------------
      
2.4.0 Saving screens
      
      Pressing  any  key  EXCEPT break, escape, D, E, M, S, Q, V, X and * save
      the screen. The program will then continue from where it left off.
      
2.4.1 Displaying saved screens
      
      Pressing S will show all the screens so far saved. Pressing  space  will
      move  onto the next screen. The program will then continue from where it
      left off.
      
2.4.2 Changing disk settings
      
      Pressing D will, after  saving  the  current  screen,  call  the  option
      settings  described  under  section  2.1 before continuing from where it
      left off.
      
2.4.3 Changing mode
      
      Pressing M will, after saving the current screen, call the mode  options
      described under section 2.2. The program will then restart with N set to
      1 once more.
      
2.4.4 Changing magnification
      
      Pressing  X  will,  after  saving  the current screen, allow the user to
      change the current magnification. The program will then restart  with  N
      set to 1 once more.
      




                                    PAGE 2
      
2.4.5 Changing expression
      
      Pressing  X  will,  after  saving  the current screen, allow the user to
      enter a new expression or change the starting  conditions.  Pressing  f0
      will  reproduce  the old equation for X1 at either the X1= prompt or the
      Y1= prompt. Similarly pressing f1 key will reproduce  the  old  equation
      for Y1. A new magnification will also be required. The program will then
      restart with N set to 1 once more.
      
2.4.6 VDU commands
      
      VDU  commands  such  as  colour  changes  can be made by pressing V. The
      screen will be saved and continue from where  it  left  off  afterwards.
      EXTREME CARE should be taken when using this command.
      
2.4.7 * commands
      
      *  commands  such  as  *.  can be made by pressing *. The screen will be
      saved and continue from where  it  left  off  afterwards.  EXTREME  CARE
      should be taken when using this command.
      
2.4.8 Quitting
      
      Pressing Q will save the screen and end the program. This is the correct
      way  to  exit. Escape and break will also stop it but without saving the
      screen. 

2.5 Using the program
---------------------

In writing this program I have had to  make  some  compromises  on  speed  and
efficiency (Any suggestions welcomed !). While trying a new set I suggest that
you  play  around  with mode, magnification etc. until you are happy. Provided
are some examples. If you start a set off and  the  values  move  outside  the
current  screen  area the screen will be saved, the magnifiction halfed and it
will try again. This makes the program idea for  'overnight  work'.  Once  you
have  a set you are interested in set it running with a high magnification and
leave it to work (overnight if nessecary !). When you return you  can  display
the  sets  from  their  earliest  generations  at  high magnification to their
overall effect at a lower magnification, and the steps in between.

2.6 Error Checking
------------------

The error checking in this program is very limited. The program tries to check
before it commences generating pictures. Disk errors simply  ask  for  another
disk  to  be  put in. An expression error will ask for another expression. All
other errors will be reported, files closed and the program terminated.

3. Examples
===========

This program is aimed at finding out for oneself the many beautiful sets.  But
by  way  of a start (and with thanks to Dr Martin) I would suggest two general
forms (Note the A's, B's, and C's can only be entered as numbers  and  not  in
any more general way.)

3.0 Equations of the form:
--------------------------
                                       
                          X[n+1] = Y[n] - SIN(X[n])
                          Y[n+1] = A - X[n]        


                                    PAGE 3
                          X[0] = 0, Y[0] = 0       

entered as:
                                       
                                 X1=Y-SIN(X)
                                 Y1=A-X     

Three ranges of A should be tried :

      A=PI : This produces a simple repetition of four points.
      
      PI<A<PI+0.07  and  PI>A>PI-0.07  :  This  will produce a
      pattern of small 'axeheads' which 'tile' the screen.
      
      A>=PI+0.07 and A<=PI-0.07 : This will produce either one
      or four axeheads only, depending on the exact  value  of
      A.

3.1 Equations of the form:
--------------------------
                                       
               X[n+1] = Y[n] - SIN(X[n]) * SQR(ABS(B*X[n] - C))
               Y[n+1] = A - X[n]                               

entered as :
                                       
                         X1=Y-SIN(X)*SQR(ABS(B*X-C))
                         Y1=A-X                     

with :
                                       
                      -5 < A,B,C < 5, and 0 < X,Y < 100

Attention  should  be drawn to the fact that A,B,C and X,Y are not nessecarily
the same.

To get you straight under way try the following in mode 1 with 2 colours, 1000
iteration colour change and maximum magnification :
                                       
                       X1 = Y-SIN(X)*SQR(ABS(.9*X-.01))
                       Y1 = 3.5-X                      
                       X  = 100                        
                       Y  = 100                        

Try leaving this for about 3 hours and then view the results.

4. Modifications
================

Due to memory limitations the program is necessarily  compact.  Machines  with
larger  RAM  than  my  32K  may  like  to  expand  the  code  and alter it. An
improvement can be made with some help.

4.0 Screen saving
-----------------

The use of a screen compactor greatly increases the  number  of  pictures  per
disk  and  avoids  disk  full  errors. I can recommend the Acorn User Magazine
*SVPIC and *LDPIC utilities. These are also available  free  on  Prestel.  The
lines which require alteration for its use are :
      
      LINE 530 DEFPROCsavescreen:LOCALS$:S$="SVPIC "+F$+CHR$(L%)
      LINES 740 & 850 Replace LOAD with LDPIC


                                    PAGE 4

Any other form of screen saving will also have to alter these lines. F$ is the
file name and CHR$(L%) the postfix.

In writing this program my intention was  merely  to  provide  a  vehicle  for
myself and other BBC micro users to look at Chaotic Sets. I in no way wish to
detract  from  the work of Dr Barry Martin of the University of Aston on whose
work  this  package  relies  heavily  for  both  its  mathematical  base   and
references.
