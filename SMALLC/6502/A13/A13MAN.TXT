Custom Toolkit 1.00
 
  ASC     <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
  BOOT    (<drv>)
  CATALL
  CLOSE
  CHKSUM  <rom>
  DIS     <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
  FILESYS
  EXPALL
  EXPLAIN
  INSERT  (<rom>)
  QUIT
  HEX     <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
  KILL    (<rom>)
  MDUMP   <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
  MEDIT   <addr> (<rom/T>)
  ROMS    (<rom>)
  SRLOAD  <fsp> <addr> <ramslot>
  SRSAVE  <fsp> <addr> <+len/end> <rom>
  SRWIPE  <ramslot>
  STATUS

 This uses the following abbreviations:
fsp   : file specification or filename
drv   : disc drive number
rom   : sideways rom number in decimal or hex
T     : select tube
addr  : hexadecimal start address
+len  : "+" followed by length in hex
end   : last address in hex
<xxxx>   - must be specified
(<xxxx>) - optional
 
 
Command: *ASC <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
Description: Memory dump in ascii format.
 
Command: *BOOT (<drv>)
Description:Execute !BOOT file on disc. Useful for some physically
handicapped persons.
Command: *CATALL
Description: Catalogue all files on ADFS disc.
 
Command: *CLOSE
Description: Close any open files. Equivalent to CLOSE#0 in BASIC.
 
Command: *CHKSUM <rom>
Description: Generate a checksum for any sideways rom image in a format
widely used by commercial eprom programmers.
 
Command: *DIS <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
Description: Disassembly of memory contents in 65C02 mnemonics.
 
Command: *FILESYS
Description: Returns currently selected filing system.
 
Command: *EXPLAIN
Description: Catalogues disc and if any BASIC programs are found that
have a REM statement in the first line, EXPLAIN will echo the associated
text to the screen. Very useful for finding programs, latest versions etc.
 
Command: *EXPALL
Description: Performs the EXPLAIN command in all directories from the
currently selected one on an ADFS disc.
 
Command: *KILL (<rom>)
Description:  Kills off sideways rom images without having to physically
unplug them. If no rom is specified then you will be prompted for a Y/N
response on each rom. Survives ctrl-break!
 
Command: *INSERT (<rom>)
Description: Opposite to *KILL. If you find that you have killed Custom
Rom, then corrupting the middle of the stack (&150,&151,&152) followed by
break will restore normality.
 
Command: *QUIT
Description: Quits current application and enter Custom Toolkit as a
simple language with a "*" prompt. All input is sent directly to the CLI.
 
Command: *HEX <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
Description: Memory dump in hexadecimal format.
 
Command: *MDUMP <addr> <+len/end> (<rom/T>)
Description: Memory dump in hexadecimal and ascii format. Similar in
format to the DFS command *DUMP.
Command: *MEDIT <addr> (<rom/T>)
Description: Powerful memory editor/bi-directional disassembler enabling
editing in hex or ascii format. Within the editor, the following keys have
special functions:
 Cursor keys - find your way around the screen with these
 Ctrl-T      - toggle tube/io memory (beeps if no tube present)
 Ctrl-G      - goto address - prompts for four digit hex number
 Ctrl-R      - select sideways rom - prompts for hex number (0-F)
 Ctrl-A      - ascii input as indicated by block cursor
 Ctrl-H      - hexadecimal input - standard cursor
 Ctrl-U      - move address indicated by cursor to top of the screen
 Ctrl-P      - print current screen
 TAB         - changes format of display
Note:
Before entering the editor, a *FX12 1 will make the display scroll faster.
 
Command: *ROMS (<rom>)
Description: Rom lister highlighting the current "active or dead" status
of all roms.
 
Command: *SRLOAD <fsp> <addr> <ramslot>
Description: Loads a rom image into sideways ram. A ctrl-break is often
needed after this.
 
Command: *SRSAVE <fsp> <addr> <+len/end> <rom>
Description: saves the contents of sideways ram or rom socket to a file.
 
Command: *SRWIPE  <ramslot>
Description: erases contents of write-enabled sideways ram.
Command: *STATUS
Description: produces a dynamic display of the current machine status.
e.g.
 
>*MSTATUS
