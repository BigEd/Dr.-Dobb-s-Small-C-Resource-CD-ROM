The C programming language is  popular for several
reasons. The language is both powerful and concise: it's 
high-level enough
to write significant programs, but it still gives you access to 
the machine
at a very low level. Perhaps, most importantly, C is portable (or 
at least as
portable as a programming language can be). Consequently a large 
body of
C language software tools has been developed, though it's hard 
sometimes
to separate the useful programs from the chaff.<p>

Though C is a good language, it's unfortunately difficult to 
learn. It can
be obscure to the point of unintelligibility and textbooks on the 
language
never seem to address real-world programming problems.<p>

This collection of articles addresses both of these problems. 
Reading through
functioning C programs is one of the best ways to learn the 
language and this
s a book of functioning programs. It's useful to see how others 
have solved
problems similar to the one you're working on right now. The book 
goes
beyond intellectual exercises though; the programs here are 
useful in their
own right. An entire C compiler, with all its support routines, 
is given here,
as are versions of various utility programs such as Grep and a C 
program
cross reference generator. Though many of these have appeared in 
<i>Dr.
Dobb's</i> over the years, there are quite a few unpublished 
programs here too.
Jim Hendrix has augmented his version of the Small-C compiler 
with an
assembler, linker, librarian and an improved I/O library. He's 
also
contributed a set of text management tools, a la Kernighan and 
Plauger. In
addition to the programs, Anthony Skjellum has distilled all his 
&quot;C
Programmer's Notebook&quot; columns into a single essay. 
Skjellum's column
was an interesting forum on C related topics and the version 
included here
provides much food for thought. Most of the programs that were 
once in the
magazine have been updated and improved from their original 
versions. Bugs
have been fixed and some additional functions have been added.<p>

The C programming community owes its thanks to the
authors whose labor is reproduced in this volume. The programs 
presented
here represent several man-years of labor, and they are being 
given to us for
free. As a group, they represent an invaluable resource, and it 
is through this
sort of selfless giving that the programming art can advance.<p>
