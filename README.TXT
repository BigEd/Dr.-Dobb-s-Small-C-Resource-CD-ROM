                     Dr. Dobb's Small-C Resource CD-ROM

Welcome to Dr. Dobb's Small-C Resource CD-ROM, the definitive collection of
Small-C related information and source code. This CD-ROM includes the full
text to James Hendrix's book "A Small-C Compiler: Language, Usage, Theory,
and Design," selected articles on Small-C from "Dr. Dobb's Journal" magazine,
and Small-C implementations for a number of processor platforms, including
the 8080, Z80, 6502, and others.

The text to both the "Small-C Compiler" book and "Dr. Dobb's Journal" articles
are provided in HTML format. To view the book and articles, you will need a 
browser. 

Once the appropriate browser is installed on your system, open the file
WELCOME.HTM, located at the root directory. This file contains 
HTML links to both the book and article files.

The Small-C compilers and related source code are available in the SMALLC
directory, located at the root directory. A brief overview of the directory
is provided (see README.ASC). Detailed documentation and readme files for
the various implementations are included in the appropriate subdirectories.

"Dr. Dobb's Journal" would like to extend a special thanks Ron Cain, James
Hendrix, Andy Yuen, and all other programmers around the world who have
contributed to the Small-C project, including Randy Dumse of New Micros,
Inc. who provided NMI ports of the Small-C compiler. We'd also like to
thank Judy Logan, Lynne Carpenter, Jennifer Macusy, and others at
Netscape Inc. for providing the browsers.

Finally, we've tried to include as many ports of the Small-C system as
possible. If you are aware of platforms not included on this CD-ROM, please
let us know and we'll do our best to include those versions in the next
release of Dr. Dobb's Small-C Resource CD-ROM.
